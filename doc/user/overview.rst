What is Crop2ML ?
=================
| **Crop2ML** is a centralized framework proposed by the Agricultural Model Exhange Initiative (**AMEI**) to exchange and reuse the plant and crop process-based model (PBM) component between PBM frameworks. 

| This framework provides a XML-(JSON-)based language used to describe different biological processes involved in the plant and crop growth and development regardless PBM frameworks.

| Any model component represented with this language will be called Crop2ML model.

Objectives
----------
The framework main objectives are:

* define a **declarative language** to describe plant and crop model components
* add semantic dimension to Crop2ML language by annotation of the models to allow the composition of components provided by different platforms by using the standards of the semantic web
* develop a library to allow the transformation and the exchange of Crop2ML model between different Crop modelling and simulation platform 
* provide a **web repository** enabling registration, search and discovery of Crop2ML Models
* facilitate Agricultural Model Exchange Initiative


Context
-------
| Nowadays, we observe the emergence of plant growth models which are built 
	in different  platforms. Although standard platform development initiatives
	are emerged, there is a lack of  transparency, reusability, and exchange 
	code between platforms due to the high diversity of modeling languages 
	leading to a lack of benchmarking between the different platforms.
| This project aims to gather developers and plant growth modelers 
	to define a standard framework based on the development of declarative language and libraries to make effectiveness the exchange and reuse of model components between platforms.
   
   
AMEI Motivation
---------------
Our motivation is to:

* Strengthen the synergy between crop modelers, users and scientific researchers
* Facilitate model intercomparison (at the process level) and model improvement through the exchange of model components (algorithms) and code reuse between platforms/models.
* Bridge the gap between ecophysiologists who develop models at the process level with crop modelers and model users and facilitate the integration in crop models of new knowledge in plant science (i.e. we are seeking the exchange of knowledge rather than black box models).
* Increase capabilities and responsiveness to stakeholderâ€™ needs.
* Propose a solution to the AgMIP community for NexGen crop modeling tools.


AMEI Vision
-----------

* Facilitate the development of complex models
* Use modular modelling to share knowledge and rapidly develop operational tools.
* Reuse model parts to leverage the expertise of third parties;
* Renovate legacy code.
* Realize the benefit of sharing and complementing different expertise.
* Promote model sharing and reuse

Crop2ML Specification 
======================

| A crop2ML model is a representation of a biophysical process involved in plant and crop growth and development
   into a Crop2ML format. Crop2ML offers a high modularity for model component description.
 Thus, a crop2ML model is either a model unit or a model composite. 

| A Crop2ML model unit is a crop2ML model with a fine granularity. It means that it doesn't depend on another model. 
| A Crop2ML model composite is a composition of two or more model unit or model composite.

| These two types of Crop2ML models each have a specific formal definition.

# CellML model representation

This directory contains cellml models (https://www.cellml.org/) created using OpenCell.
The purpose of CellML is to store and exchange computer-based mathematical models.

The aim of this repository is to express agricultural models in CellML to explore its expressivness but also its limits.

The current model is the Penman-Nontheith model, implemented in Sirius (http://www1.clermont.inra.fr/siriusquality/?page_id=547).

To view the model, open it with OpenCell.
